#Github basics

In this introductory section I'll be showing you how to work with github in order to create, fork, and update repositories.  I'll also explain the basics of submitting pull requests, and updating your fork from the main repository.

##Installation

_Ubuntu_:

If you are working on ubuntu (congradulations on making the correct decision).  All you need to do is the following:

Open a terminal window and enter the following:

```
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install git
```

Then head over to github.com and sign up for an account.  From there you should [add ssh-keys](https://help.github.com/articles/generating-ssh-keys/) to making pushing and pulling easier.  (Of course this is optional and not recommended on all systems). Say you are using a work computer - it's probably best not to add ssh-keys, unless it's to a work account.

_Windows_:

For windows you'll need to download the [git-installer](https://git-scm.com/download/win).  Once that has been downloaded you'll need to add git to your environment variables.  There are slightly different instructions for [windows 7](http://www.nextofwindows.com/how-to-addedit-environment-variables-in-windows-7/) and [windows 8](http://www.itechtics.com/customize-windows-environment-variables/).  Make sure to reference the folder with the git binary when adding to your path.  It is recommended that you install git to your C drive.  

_OSX_:

For mac simply use [this installer](http://git-scm.com/download/mac).

If these directions were unclear here is the [official git installation guide](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git)
