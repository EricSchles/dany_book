#Lesson One

Welcome to your introduction to Programming!!  Thanks so much for checking this tutorial and I hope you learn a lot!

lesson plan:

* Installation
* First Program
* Running the program

##Preamble/Requirements gathering

Before we can get started with programming, we'll need to install a few things.  In truth, programming is really just a form of writing, where the words you write have power.  If you write words in the correct way, they can do almost anything.  So in a sense, programming is magic (in a true sense).  After all, you are controlling electricity at the end of the day :)

So what does any form of writing on a device need?  (the answer is two things)

1) A text editor to write with,
2) An idea to write down.

For programming, we'll add a third thing:

3) A way to run the written text.

##Installation

So now that we know sort of what we need, we'll be specific.  We will need 

0) You - our idea generator
1) Emacs - our text editor
2) A Python Interpretter - our way to run our code

###Installing Emacs

There are various operating systems that have you can program on.  I'll cover the major ones here.

Linux: Standard installation from your favorite package manager :)

Ubuntu: `sudo apt-get install emacs` (from the terminal)

(Mac OSX package)[http://emacsformacosx.com/]

(Windows 7 & 8 package)[https://ftp.gnu.org/gnu/emacs/windows/emacs-24.5-bin-i686-mingw32.zip]

###Adding Python to your path (windows only)

Once you have successfully downloaded the emacs folder you'll need to unzip it and then copy it to your c drive (or whatever you've named your hard drive).  From there the instructions vary slightly.

####On Windows 7

Click the start button (lower left) and right click on computer>properties

This will open a new window.  Find Advanced system settings (third option on the left hand side of the window).  From there, click on environment variables.  

In the new window, under system variables, select the variable named Path. (You'll need to scroll to see this).  Then click edit and append the following to the path: C:\emacs-24.5-bin-i686-mingw32/bin; to the text.  Now click OK and then exit out of all the other windows.

####On Windows 8

On the search in windows 8 type in System Environment variables.  From there the steps are the same as with windows 7.
