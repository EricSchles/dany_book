#Understanding logic

The basic tentants of logic are pretty simple - statements can either be true or false.  

So let's say you had the statement:

My name is Sam (and say my name was infact sam).  Then the statement would be true.

It's important to be aware that not all statements will be true or false.

##Understanding composite statements

Now that we understand that a statement can be true or false, let's understand how to combine simple logical statements to form larger logical statements.  This is done via connector words such as AND, OR, NOT, XOR, and a few others.  The ones of primary concern for us will be AND, OR, and NOT.  

###Understanding the AND statement

The AND statement looks at the left hand side and right hand side of a statement and evaluates the composite statement as either true or false.  

So say we had the two following statements:

```
x = 4
5 < x and x == 4
```

In the above example, we'd have a true statement.
